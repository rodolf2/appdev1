As a manager, it can be challenging to handle a situation where a key member of the team has a personal problem while managing to meet tight deadlines. My first approach would be to understand and empathize with the developer's situation while assessing the current status of the project. I would quickly analyze the workload, reassign tasks within the team if possible, and look into bringing in additional support or temporary help to fill any gaps. To ensure transparency, I’d communicate the situation to both the team and the client in a professional manner, providing realistic expectations for the adjusted timeline and emphasizing our commitment to the project’s success. By staying proactive, supporting my team, and maintaining clear communication, I could help keep the project on track while respecting the developer’s personal needs.

As a developer facing a family emergency, I will promptly bring this to the notice of my manager and involve him in all aspects of visibility pertaining to my current tasks and deadlines. I will work to complete any urgent tasks or prepare notes that will make the handover easy, hence minimizing disruption. If necessary, I would seek flexible arrangements, such as working from home or flexible hours, and maintain open communication with my team to be abreast of the progress of the projects. In this manner, I can handle my workload responsibly while at the same time minimizing the impact on the project timeline. 

To better anticipate such risks, both the manager and developer could have discussed potential backup plans early on, especially given the collaboration’s tight deadline. Proactive strategies like cross-training team members, establishing contingency plans, and scheduling regular check-ins could have allowed for quicker adjustments when the unexpected occurred. By planning for risks, the team could have been better prepared to handle sudden changes without compromising the project’s success.
